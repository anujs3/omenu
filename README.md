Message Bot for Finding Vegetarian Items on the Menu

## Description

Text the name of a restaurant to 415-360-MENU (415-360-6368) to find all of the vegetarian dishes on the menu.

You can specify location by using the following format: {RESTAURANT} @ {CITY}, {STATE}. If no location is given, then it will try to find restaurants near your phone's area code.

## How It Works

This application is running on a Flask server and uses Twilio's Programmable SMS API to send messages directly to your phone.
